Currently this project attempts to find non-isomorphic binary matroids with
identical configurations of lattices of cyclic flats.
In the future we hope to have an algorithm reconstructing a matroid
from such a configuration.

### Benchmarks (i7-9700K):
- Exhaustive search through 4&times;5 binary matrices took some 17 minutes.
