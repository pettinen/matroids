Currently this project attempts to find non-isomorphic binary matroids with
identical configurations of lattices of cyclic flats.
In the future we hope to have an algorithm reconstructing a matroid
from such a configuration.

#### Benchmarks (exhaustive search through _m_&times;_n_ binary matrices on an i7-9700K):
* 4&times;5: 10 min 37 s
